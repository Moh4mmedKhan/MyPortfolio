  aboutMe:
    "I’m 18 and currently pursuing my Diploma in Computer Engineering and IoT. Over time, I discovered my real passion lies in cybersecurity — understanding how systems work, how they break, and how to defend them. With skills in Python, C, C++, Kali Linux, and networking, I’m training myself to become a disciplined ethical hacker and cybersecurity analyst through practical, project-driven learning.",
